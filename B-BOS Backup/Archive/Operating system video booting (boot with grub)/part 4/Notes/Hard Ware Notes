Part 4:
Hardware communication

This is the part where we will communicate with the hardware
When you interact with a hardware piece, it will send a signal to the PIC (Programmical interupt controler).
if we want to get the data from the PIC, we need to program the PIC to send us the information. To do this
we will have a multplexer and a decomplexer. //look up more info//. We will send data or a number to these
complexers and they will send or recive data from a port. 

In assembly there is a command called "outb" that is used to do this. Because we are writing this in C++, 
we will use the asm("") command to use assembly code.
