PCI NOTES:

VIDEO:

The PCI stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect
- It is virtually the only bus computer systems
- Bus: is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer
- A PCI contains it own registers, that contain information about the connected device
- A PCI bridge is is hardware connection between two different buses. Meaning you can have many layers of buses in the PCI
- The main or first bridge is a host bridge, and is also emblumented as a chip set
- chip set is the combination of the number of different controlers
- 32-bit card has connection 1 through 62.
- 64-bit card has 94 connections
- address and data buses are labed as AD(lower^0)--AD(lower^64), and can multiplex
- multiplexing: is the ability to send multiple signals combined in one signal.
- The PCI ADDRESS appears on AD(lower^0)--AD(lower^31) and is multiplexed with data
- PCI contains 256-byte memory to allow the PC to interrogate the PCI interface
- Interrogate: means to search, count or test the condition of status of a device.
- This allows for the system to automatically configure itself for the PCI plug-board, also called plug-and-play(PnP)
- the first 64 bytes contain information about the PCI interface
- the first 32-bit doubleword(4 bytes or 32-bits) contains the unit ID code and the vendor ID code
- The configuration space contains the registers that store important information about the device.
- configuration space table

Location : (if ##H Decimal Number) : Discription: Size
(0-Byte) 00H: Header : 64 bytes
	(0-Byte) : 00H : The first doubleword (4-bytes or 32-bits) Contain:
		(0-2 Byte): Vendor ID (2-Byte or 16-bit)
		(2-4 Byte): Device ID (2-Byte or 16-bit)
	(4-Byte) : 04H : The second double word contain:
		(4-6 Byte): Command : (2-Byte or 16-bit)
		(6-8 Byte): Status : (2-Byte or 16-bit)
	(8-Byte) : 08H : The third doubleword:
		(8-9 Byte) : Revision ID : (1-byte or 8-bits)
		(9-12 Byte) : Class Code : (3-Bytes or 24-bits)

Write Your OS 10:
- The PCI or Peripheral Component Interconnect is a component used for allowing multiple devices and drivers
be used without spefically setting each one
- The Peripheral Component Interconnect has up to 8 connections/buses.
- On every bus you can have up to 32 devices
- Every Devices can have up to 8 functions, a function is like a sound card as a audio capture or soundcard i.e. Having multiple function.
- We have Ports : 8, Devices : 32, Functions : 8, so we will need 3-bits for ports, 5-bits for devices, and 3-bits for functions
- When we ask the PCI what is Bus # Device #, it will return a
    uint16_t vendor_id : who is making it
    uint16_t device_id : what device number is it for that vendor
    ....
    uint8_t class_id: if we want to get the VGA driver, we will just look at the class_id to get it
    uint8_t subclass_id
    
- The Peripheral component interconnect has a port of 32-bit
- When we read data from devices, they have memory locations and have a standerized memory space. So we will have to read the offset
of the memory where we would find the vendor_id, device_id, etc
- We will combine the port/bus, device, and function number into one identifier to send to the PCI
- An Identifier is a name that is assigned by the user for a program element such as variable, type, template, etc.
- If you want information out of the indentifier, like the bus, device, function, you will get the whole indentifier, and select the byte out of the 32bit indentifier
- What we want to do is give the driver manager to the PCI and have the PCI talk to the Driver Manager, and insert the drivers on the PCI
- If the Vendor_id is all zeros or ones, that means it is empty
